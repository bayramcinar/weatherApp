# weatherApp
In this project, I made a weather app by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are different videos according to the city's weather. There is a search panel, you can search the city that you want to learn the weather of it. There are temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In this project, I learned how I can use API in JavaScript.
